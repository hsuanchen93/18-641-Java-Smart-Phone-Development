Project Description:

This Android application is a smart alarm clock designed for those who find it hard to wake up in the morning.

This alarm clock is equipped with the conceptual idea of only allowing the user to turn off the alarm after the user has completed a task. One task is to solve a mathematical problem correctly while the other task involves taking a selfie where the application can clearly see that the user has opened both eyes.

In the application, we implemented multiple features. We implemented the application to use the camera to take a wakeup-selfie, to use the speaker to sound the alarm, and to use the GPS to detect the userâ€™s location in deciding whether or not the application should sound the alarm.

Our project has both local and remote storages. We implemented the local SQLite database on the Android device to store the information of our objects. On the other hand, we implemented a remote MySQL database to store our math problems/solutions.



Steps to execute the project:

1. Start the MySQL server.

2. Run the Driver in Eclipse.

3. At this point, the server should be up and running with the correct configuration and waiting for connections from the client Android apps.

4. Install the project on an Android device and open up the app.
